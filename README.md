Algorithm Practice in Python

### Selection Sort
Worst-case: O(n^2)

### Quick Sort
Worst-case: O(n^2)
Average-case: O(n log n)

### Breadth-first Search (BFS)
Used in Unidirectional Unweighted Graphs
Used to find out the shortest path (less number of vertices)
Worst-case: O(V + E) -> V: Vertices, E: Edges

### Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Used in Unidirectional Weighted Graphs
Used to find out shortest path (least total weights)

# DS and Algo Terms

### Auxiliary Space
space taken up by the algorithm itself and not the input
- Most primitive (booleans, None) are constant space
- Strings require O(n) space
- Reference types (arrays or dicts) need O(n)

### Array Sorting Algorithms - Average Time Complexity
- Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
- Selection Sort: O(n^2)
- Insertion sort: O(n^2)
- Quick Sort: O(n log n)
- Merge Sort: O(n log n)
**These sorting algorithms are grouped together as COMPARISON Sorting Algorithms**
- Radix Sort


### Radix Sort
- It is an Integer Sort where no comparisons between the numbers is actually done
- It uses the size of a number to sort it
- Reads the digits of every number in an array from least significant to most significant
